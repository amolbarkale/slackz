## Key Features Implementation

### Real-time Messaging
- Built with Convex real-time subscriptions
- Instant message delivery and updates
- Live typing indicators and presence

### AI Integration
- Google Gemini Pro for intelligent responses
- Context-aware conversation analysis
- Professional response generation
- Error handling and fallbacks

### File Handling
- Secure file uploads via Convex storage

## Development Notes

1. For the API hooks, [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) is used to wrap the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hook from `convex/react`.
2. For form handling, [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) is used.
3. Real-time functionality is powered by Convex's built-in WebSocket connections and live queries.
4. AI features use Google Gemini API with proper error handling and rate limiting considerations.
