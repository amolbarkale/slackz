## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture (Convex)

**AI Response Mutation**
```javascript
export const generateAIResponse = mutation({
  args: {
    workspaceId: v.id("workspaces"),
    channelId: v.optional(v.id("channels")),
    conversationId: v.optional(v.id("conversations")),
    parentMessageId: v.optional(v.id("messages")),
    contextMessageId: v.id("messages"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Authentication and authorization
    // Context gathering (last 10 messages)
    // AI processing with Google Gemini
    // Response message creation
  }
});
```

**Context Gathering Logic**
- Query messages using indexed database lookups
- Respect conversation boundaries (channel/DM/thread)
- Populate user information for context
- Build chronological conversation history
- Handle edge cases (empty conversations, deleted messages)

**AI Integration**
- Google Gemini Pro model for response generation
- Structured prompt with conversation context
- Error handling for API failures
- Response formatting and validation

### Frontend Architecture (React)

**Hook Implementation**
```typescript
export const useGenerateAIResponse = () => {
  const mutation = useConvexMutation(api.messages.generateAIResponse);
  return useReactQueryMutation({ mutationFn: mutation });
};
```

**UI Components**
- Enhanced Toolbar component with AI button
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

**State Management**
- Integration with existing message state
- Real-time updates via Convex subscriptions
- Error state handling and recovery
- Loading state coordination

### Data Flow

**AI Response Generation Flow**
1. User clicks AI button on target message
2. Frontend validates permissions and context
3. Backend gathers conversation context (10 messages)
4. AI processes context and generates response
5. Response saved as new message in database
6. Real-time update delivers response to all users
7. Success notification shown to triggering user

**Error Handling Flow**
1. API failures â†’ Generic error message
2. Context gathering issues â†’ Fallback to single message
3. Rate limiting â†’ Clear user feedback
4. Network issues â†’ Retry mechanism
5. Invalid permissions â†’ Silent failure (no button shown)

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
**Context Privacy**
